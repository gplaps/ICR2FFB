#give it a try if you get really abrupt forces or no force at all



# === Effect Mix ===
#Each effect can be turned on or off with the main toggle ('true' or 'false')
#Scale settings will control balance for that given force. I personally tuned it at 100% for all of them

Constant: true
Constant Scale: 100
#General main effect which will add force to the wheel to simulate G load, this is the main force

Damper: true
Damper Scale: 50
#Damper adds friction to the wheel at slow speed (under 50mph) to help simulate non-powered steering

#I recommend keeping this off unless you just like the wheel to center itself not based on physics
